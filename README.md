# Cryptography Algorithims

I implemented code (in rust) for:

- Euclidean Algorithim (in "src/euclidean.rs")
- Extended Euclidean Algorithim (in "src/euclidean.rs")
- Chinese Remainder Theorem (in "src/chinese.rs")

There is also a simple command line interface where users can use the three algoithims (in "src/cli.rs")
